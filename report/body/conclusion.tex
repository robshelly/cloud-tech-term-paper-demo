\section{Conclusion}
On successfully completing the practical element of this paper the sample node app could be easily modified and updated on the server using the automated Jenkins pipeline. This successfully demonstrated the continuous integration and continuous deployment workflow that was desired.

The workflow demonstrated how Jenkins suite of plugins can be used to create jobs or indeed pipelines that integrate the various service needed to build, test and deploy a web app. This consisted of integrating the source code on GitHub, Docker images and registries and various AWS services for deployment and management. The practical work also successfully implemented a secure methods od providing credentials to the Jenkins server, including both Docker Hub credentials and AWS credentials created using IAM.
